C is a high level and general-purpose programming language. C was developed at AT & T’s Bell Laboratories of the USA in 1972. It was designed and written by a computer scientist named Dennis Ritchie.

#### Why C programming?

Low level and powerful programming Language
Good memory management.
Handle low-level activities
Compiled on a variety of computer platforms
Once you master C programming, you can easily learn another specified language.

#### Uses of C

- Operating Systems
- Language Compilers Language Interpreters
- Assemblers
- Text Editors
- Hardware and Network Drivers
- Modern Programs
- Databases
- Utilities

C was designed to implement the Unix operating system. Most of the Unix kernel and all of its supporting tools and libraries were written in C . it is the precursor and inspiration for almost all of the most popular high-level languages available today. In fact, Perl, PHP , python, and ruby are all written in C.

C will still be there in 100 years. All the major operating systems are written in C. The language of Microsoft Windows at the API level is C. GNU tools are often written in C.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    printf("Hello world");
    return 0;
}
```

```output
Hello world
```

In terms of performance (CPU time or memory consumption), C or even C++ is unbeatable. There are still many programmers who still use C programming in making their projects. It’s used by a wide range of programmers, from amateurs working on simple projects at home, to industry professionals who write in C for a living.

It’s been used to program everything from the tiny microcontrollers used in watches too. It can give you control over the smallest details of how the processor operates, which simplifies to read and learn code. C tries to make the best of a computer by linking it as closely as possible to the local environment. C also contains extra features that allow it to be used at a lower level. This flexibility allows C to be used for systems programming as well as for application programming. C encourages users to write additional library functions of their own.

Moreover, in an industry where newer languages, tools, and technologies emerge and vanish day in and day out. But C has survived for more than 3 decades has to be really good. Major parts of popular operating systems like Windows, UNIX, Linux is still written in C. Even today when it comes to performance (speed of execution) nothing beats C. When you understand C, you understand how computers, operating systems, and algorithms work. Many popular gaming frameworks have been built using C language. The C language gives you a lot more control over how your program uses the computer’s memory.

The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it.

Understanding how to use C is an ongoing process. There are new things to be learned every day. Nothing is perfect, but you should try to become perfect.
