Yeah, it’s day 1 as a tech advocate readers for you, ops forget to mention the day 0 blog. If you haven’t read you can read out here. So, We learned a little bit about the overall software development and it’s the life cycle.

#### what the heck is Software Development

Well, it’s the process of writing the source code which includes everything that is involved between the conception of the desired software through to the final manifestation of the software. Software development may include research, re-engineering, or maybe changing out the whole stack of the software product too. The misconception of people about Software development is that it’s all about coding stuff laying down on the computer with a bunch of coffee.

There are many approaches to software project management known as the software development life cycle. One of the famous and old ones is the waterfall model as you may have heard too. For the beginner one, there might be a misconception about the waterfall model, it’s not a model girl sitting behind the waterfall. It’s the mythology that software engineers follow and ship out their code into production. There are a few steps to implement the waterfall model in your daily software engineer day.

- Requirements Analysis
- Design
- Development
- Testing
- Maintenance

These are the basic steps that software engineers follow but there might be more steps too but this is the basic one. There are many processes too it’s not like there is only a waterfall model for the software development life cycle.

So why others exist? Because there needs to be improvements in this waterfall model and other reasons too. Some of the drawbacks of the waterfall model are listed below.

- Too hard to incorporate new changes or requirements.
- The project delivert gets too late.
- Difficult to measure progress.
- High amound of risk and uncertainty

One thing is that all the things in the waterfall model are dependent on each other. What’s the solution to that?

##### Agile comes into the big picture

The Etymological meaning of Agile means to move quickly and easily. Agile is a process by which a team can manage a project by breaking it up into several stages and involving constant collaboration with stakeholders and continuous improvement and iteration at every stage.

Agile includes the following procedures.

- Plan
- Design
- Develop
- Test
- Release
- Feedbacks

Few benefits of Agile

- High Product Quality
- Higher customer satisfaction
- Increased project control
- Easy and predictable delivery
- More focused on business value and quality

Now, let’s dig dive into Development and Coding Stuff.

Coding is a part of the process where software engineers program the code for the project. Coding can be classified into many types. Commonly on web development, there are four types.

- Frontend Development
- Backend Development
- DevOps
- Database

#### Frontend Development

Front-end is a part that users interact with. Everything you see while browsing through your computer or mobile is a part of front-end development. It takes a bigger role. Major technologies used in Front-end Development are:

- HTML
- CSS and it's preprocessors
- Javascript and it's libraries
- Frontend framework
  - React
  - Angular
  - Vue
  - Other

#### What is Backend Development

It’s the part of the software which determines how the whole functionality of the application works. You are mostly focused on business logic to solve their problem through your code. You have to work with the database to perform CRUD( Create, Read, Update & Delete) operations and working with APIs (Application Programming Interface) to render where you wanted too and other tasks. There are tons of language to use as a back-end language. Some of them are listed below.

- Go lang
- Python
- Java
- Javascript
- Php
- Many more

#### Database

Data is everywhere in today’s world even in your motion too. So what’s the relation between data and database? Well, database management data that you wanted. The database is a collection of data used for storing, managing, and retrieving information. You used social media and you chat with your friends and message transfer from your phone to server and server to your friend. Here, the message is your data, and to manage that data, the database takes action. There are many databases out there. Some are SQL and NO-SQL database.

- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- DynamoDB
- MongoDB
- Oracle
- Many more

We learned a lot and it was worth it. Now, there is something new too.

### DevOps

It’s a set of operating principles and collection of practices that enable application development teams to deliver code change more frequently and reliably. It’s the interaction of development and operation tasks. The benefits of DevOps are listed below.

- Enhances the quality of code
- Easier to detect issue and fix it
- Active involvement of end user
- Reduces the cost to the company over a period of time
- Smaller and more frequent updates are possible

#### What is a Full stack Developer anyway ?

I think there is no exact definition of Full stack development. There are the ones considered as the jack of all trades but master of something specific too. A full-stack developer is an engineer who can handle all the work of databases, servers, systems engineering, and clients. It doesn’t mean that they will be coding 24/7 hours. They will work on a project where they will be wearing many hats and they are capable of working new technologies too within a few spans of times. These are just the basic things we learned but with each and small topic, there is the vast scope of it which I can’t share in a single blog.

#### A day in a life of Software Engineer

At the end of the session, we learned about how the software engineer spent time in the company. Note, it might be different from the company to the company too. These are the basic things that include in software engineer daily workout.

- Meeting
- Task & Features Discussion
- Study, reasearch and knowledge gathering
- Problem solving
- Coding
- Helping each other out
- Hanging out with coworkers and having coffee
- Having fun

I was really excited about day 1 too. We are learning each and everything parallel. I learned few things already so I easily caught those concepts too. I hope you might feel worth reading my article. Thank you.
