When you start first with a programming language, you don’t want to start with tough syntax and weird rules right. Then Python is the best option to start with your programming journey. As I said, it’s important to know the programming language. If you don’t know then you are missing something in this digital world.

Python is a general-purpose dynamic programming language that focuses on code readability. Python is also a high level and interpreted language. There are many reasons to learn python programming language if you are going on a programming journey as a beginner.

#### Large Developer Community

Python user is so large that anyone encountering any coding and programming problems can quickly find solutions by posting questions or searching for answers on the python developer community, forums, stack overflow, and many more. Surprisingly, many developers don’t choose python as a primary language and but they python as a secondary language too. This is also the reason for being popular.

Many tech companies sponsor programming languages like Microsoft sponsors C#, Sun sponsors Java, Apple sponsors Swift. Python has some great sponsors too and google is one of them. Wanna know more.

Python is growing, it doesn’t mean others are declining.

#### Ease of learning, Readable and Maintainable Code

Python makes sense because it’s simple and the main reason for learning Python is simplicity. Python is also known for its high reliability and simple syntax which are drawn for new coders in particular. If you need code that works on Linux, Windows, macOS then python is the answer. It runs on all platforms. Python is more than capable of large scale applications. Instagram is the largest site running with python with Django (web framework).

#### Discover of AI, ML and Data Science Field

Growth in python use has been the fastest among computer scientists and researchers, AI/ML engineers, and data scientists too. Yeah, you might be thinking R programming language is also there in this field, but still, python can also do better and more productive in this field. Hey, I am not saying R beat python in the data science world, both languages have pros and cons. But still, Python is used mostly.

#### Multiple Programming Paradigms

Python can be used in almost anything field, which is why it is considered so versatile. Python is its swiss army nature. Python supports Object-oriented concepts, function programming, and structure programming too. Python is widely used in bigger organizations too because of its multiple programming paradigms.

- Facebook
- Instagram
- Reddit
- Quora
- Startup and many more

#### Awesome Libraries

Python is an open-source one too, and lots of developers contributed to its internal features and made awesome libraries and frameworks which helps you to curtail software development cost significantly. You can even have an option to choose from data science libraries like Tensorflow, Numpy to web frameworks like Django, Flask.

#### Conclusion

Thanks, you made it to the end of article. Good luck with your python journey. And Never give up learning and take advantage from this article.

There are so many programming languages out there that choosing a language can be stressful. Truth is, there can never be perfect language in all fields and for everything.
